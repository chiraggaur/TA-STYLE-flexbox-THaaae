                   <p class="para1">

                    Sant'Agata Bolognese, September 22, 2022 - In 2022 Lamborghini is celebrating the V12:

                     the legendary 12-cylinder engine that has powered its most iconic models for almost 60 years. 
                     
                     Among these is the Murci√©lago, the Lamborghini model which, making its first appearance at the 

                     Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2001, had the task of taking the historical V12 engine into the 21st century. 

                     And it did this in the most extraordinary way, given that when this model made its debut, the 6.2-liter engine 

                     had a maximum power output of 580 HP. This was extremely high, considering the use of the large catalytic converters 

                     required for the car to be approved in all world markets, including the most stringent ones in terms of emissions
